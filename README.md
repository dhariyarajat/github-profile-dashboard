## 🔍 How It Works

1. User enters a GitHub username.
2. The application sends requests to the GitHub API.
3. Profile and repository data are fetched in parallel using Promise.all().
4. The UI is updated dynamically using JavaScript.
5. Recent searches are stored locally using LocalStorage.
6. Users can search and filter repositories in real time.
